Acoustic measures
*****************

One of the most important steps in analyzing a corpus is taking acoustic measurements of the data in the corpus. The acoustics
functions listed here allow you to analyze and save acoustics into the database, to be queried later. There are several
automatic acoustics functions in PolyglotDB, and you can also encode other measures using the Praat script function.
